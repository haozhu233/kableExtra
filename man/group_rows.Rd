\arguments{
\item{kable_input}{Output of \code{knitr::kable()} with \code{format} specified}

\item{group_label}{A character string for the name of the group}

\item{start_row}{A numeric value that tells the function in which row the
group starts. Note that the counting excludes header rows and other group
labeling rows}

\item{end_row}{A numeric value that tells the function in which row the group
ends.}

\item{index}{A named vector providing the index for robust row-grouping tasks.
Basically, you can use it in the same way as \code{add_header_above()}.}

\item{label_row_css}{A character string for any customized css used for the
labeling row. By default, the labeling row will have a solid black line
underneath. Only useful for HTML documents.}

\item{latex_gap_space}{A character value telling LaTeX how large the gap
between the previous row and the group labeling row. Only useful for LaTeX
documents.}

\item{escape}{A T/F value showing whether special characters should be
escaped.}

\item{latex_align}{Adjust justification of group_label in latex only. Value should be "c" for
centered on row, "r" for right justification, or "l" for left justification. Default
Value is "l"  If using html, the alignment can be set by using the label_row_css
parameter.}

\item{latex_wrap_text}{T/F for wrapping long text. Default is off. Whenever
it is turned on, the table will take up the entire line. It's recommended
to use this with full_width in kable_styling.}

\item{colnum}{A numeric that determines how many columns the text should span.
The default setting will have the text span the entire length.}

\item{bold}{A T/F value to control whether the text should be bolded.}

\item{italic}{A T/F value to control whether the text should to be emphasized.}

\item{hline_before}{A T/F value that adds a horizontal line before the group_row label.  Default
value is False.}

\item{hline_after}{A replicate of \code{hline.after} in xtable. It
adds a hline after the row}

\item{extra_latex_after}{Extra LaTeX text to be added after the row.}

\item{indent}{A T/F value to control whether list items are indented.}

\item{monospace}{T/F value to control whether the text of the
selected column need to be monospaced (verbatim)}

\item{underline}{T/F value to control whether the text of the
selected row need to be underlined}

\item{strikeout}{T/F value to control whether the text of the
selected row need to be struck out.}

\item{color}{A character string for column text color. Here please
pay attention to the differences in color codes between HTML and LaTeX.}

\item{background}{A character string for column background color. Here please
pay attention to the differences in color codes between HTML and LaTeX.}

\description{
Group a few rows in a table together under a label.
}
\details{
In HTML output, it is an error to insert a break
between groups that would fall within collapsed rows
produced by \code{\link[=collapse_rows]{collapse_rows()}}.  To work around
this, modify the column entries that follow the break
to be different from those before the break, e.g.
by adding a zero-width space (Unicode \code{"\\u200B"})
to those in the later group, so that \code{\link[=collapse_rows]{collapse_rows()}}
will think the entries are different and will not
collapse them together.

\examples{
\dontrun{
x <- knitr::kable(head(mtcars), "html")
# Put Row 2 to Row 5 into a Group and label it as "Group A"
pack_rows(x, "Group A", 2, 5)
}
